== Name

dotbackup - YAML config based backup utility

== Synopsis

*dotbackup* [-h|--help] [-c|--config _CONFIG_] [-V|--version] [--clean]
[--log-level _LOG_LEVEL_] [_APP_...]

== Description

Usually people maintain backup and setup scripts along with their dotfiles. But
these scripts always contain a lot of repeat codes, and writing them is not fun!
dotbackup and dotsetup are here to help.

With these two tools, you only need to write a simple configuration and they
will know how to back up and set up your dotfiles. See the _CONFIGURATION_
section for the configuration definition.

When you invoke dotbackup, it copies each application's _files_ to the
_backup_dir_ (if no _app_ provided, all application's _files_ will be copied).
And dotsetup does the opposite. Backup file's relative path to the _backup_dir_
is the same as the original file's relative path to the home directory, so
dotsetup knows how to copy them back.

== Options

*-h, --help*::
	Show help message and exit.

*-c, --config*=_CONFIG_::
	Set configuration file (default: ~/.config/dotbackup/dotbackup.yml). See
	_CONFIGURATION_ section for the expected structure of this file.

*-V, --version*::
	Print the version information and exit.

*--clean*::
	Do clean backup, i.e., delete old backup files before backup.

*--log-level* _LOG_LEVEL_::
	Set the log level, _LOG_LEVEL_ may be one of DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR,
	CRITICAL. The default is INFO.

== Configuration

The default configuration file path is _~/.config/dotbackup/dotbackup.yml_. The
configuration file uses YAML syntax, following are the configuration keyword
definitions.

_backup_dir_::
	A string. The directory where backup files are stored.

_clean_::
	A boolean. Whether to delete files in destination path before backup and
	setup. The default is `false`. Option *--clean* override this configuration.

_ignore_::
	A list of glob strings. The global ignored file patterns. Files that matches
	one of these patterns will be ignored. But files that are directly specified
	in _apps.<app>.files_ are not ignored.

_apps.<app>.files_::
	A list of path strings. The files to be backed up of the application _<app>_,
	_<app>_ can be any string. File paths *MUST* be relative to the home directory
	due to implementation. You can use _HOOKS_ to manipulate other files.

_apps.<app>.ignore_::
	A list of glob strings. The application level ignored file patterns. Files
	that matches one of these patterns will be ignored when back up and set up
	_<app>_. But files that are directly specified in _apps.<app>.files_ are not
	ignored.

_apps.<app>.<pre_backup|post_backup|pre_setup|post_setup>_::
	A list of script strings. The application level custom hooks, _<app>_ can be
	any string. See _HOOKS_ and _EXAMPLES_ for details.

_<pre_backup|post_backup|pre_setup|post_setup>_::
	A list of script strings. The global custom hooks. See _HOOKS_ and _EXAMPLES_
	for details.

== Hooks

Technically, hooks are just shell scripts to be executed by `sh -s`. They can be
divide into backup hooks and setup hooks. The execution order is indicated by
their names. For example, the execution order of backup hooks may be like this:

[%hardbreaks]
pre_backup
apps.app1.pre_backup
copy _apps.app1.files_
apps.app1.post_backup
apps.app2.pre_backup
copy _apps.app2.files_
apps.app2.post_backup
post_backup

And in hooks, you can use the environment variable _BACKUP_DIR_ which is set to
_backup_dir_. So you can use hooks to things beyond copying _files_, e.g., file
post-processing.

== Examples

First of all, dotbackup can back up itself:

....
backup_dir: ~/backup
apps:
  dotbackup:
    files: [~/.config/dotbackup/dotbackup.yml]
....

A configuration back up Vim and Neovim:

....
backup_dir: ~/backup
apps:
  vim:
    files: [~/.vimrc]
  nvim:
    files:
      - ~/.config/nvim/init.lua
      - ~/.config/nvim/lua
....

A configuration which use hooks to generate timestamp and make Git commit:

....
backup_dir: ~/backup
apps:
  vim:
    files: [~/.vimrc]
  nvim:
    files:
      - ~/.config/nvim/init.lua
      - ~/.config/nvim/lua
post_backup:
  - date > "$BACKUP_DIR/timestamp"
  - |
    set -e
    cd $BACKUP_DIR
    git commit -am "backup of $(date)"
    git push
....

A configuration which ignore some files:

....
backup_dir: ~/backup
apps:
  nvim:
    files: [~/.config/nvim]
    ignore: [lazy-lock.json]
ignore: [.git]
....
